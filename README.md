Sign-Up Form — The Odin Project
📌 Overview

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum.
The goal was to build a responsive sign-up form layout using HTML and CSS, focusing on structure, layout, and form styling — without using JavaScript.

🎯 What I Learned

Completing this project helped me deeply understand several core frontend concepts:

🧱 HTML Structure

How to properly structure a page using semantic and logical containers

Why parent–child relationships matter for layout

How correct HTML structure makes CSS easier and more predictable

📐 CSS Layout (Flexbox & Grid)

How display: flex works and how flex: 1 distributes space

How to split a page into left (image) and right (content) sections

Using CSS Grid to create clean, two-column form layouts

🖼️ Background Images & Positioning

Why background images belong in CSS, not HTML

How background-size: cover and background-position: center work

The difference between position: relative and position: absolute

How absolute positioning depends on a positioned parent

🧠 Form Styling & UX

Styling input focus states using :focus

Understanding what “focus” means for accessibility

Using :invalid to show validation feedback without JavaScript

Why labels are better than placeholders for accessibility

📏 CSS Units & Specificity

The difference between rem, em, and px

How multiple CSS rules can apply to the same element

When and why it’s okay to merge CSS selectors

🤖 About AI Usage

I’m especially happy with this project because:

I did not rely heavily on AI tools

I debugged layout issues by reasoning through HTML structure and CSS behavior

I asked questions to understand concepts, not to copy solutions blindly

This project helped me build confidence that I can:

Read documentation

Think through problems

Debug issues logically

Learn frontend development the right way
